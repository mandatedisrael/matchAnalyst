# ai.ball

**AI football analyst** for fans who want data-backed, TEE-verified match breakdowns before placing a bet on [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) or [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com).

ai.ball is not a sportsbook and not a Polymarket product. It researches fixtures across major leagues and competitions, runs analysis in 0G’s Trusted Execution Environment, and surfaces win/draw/away probabilities with clear reasoning. When a prediction market exists for the match, a direct link to **Polymarket** (or **Kalshi** as fallback) is attached so you can compare the model to live market prices.

**Live:** [https://aiballanalysis.vercel.app](https://aiballanalysis.vercel.app) · **Repo:** [github.com/mandatedisrael/ai.ball](https://github.com/mandatedisrael/ai.ball)

## What you get

- **TEE-verified AI analysis** — inference runs in an attestable 0G environment; responses are marked as TEE verified
- **Data-backed research** — team form, head-to-head, standings, weather, and match context from football APIs
- **Live match centre** — scores, goal scorers, lineups, stats, cards, and subs when the provider publishes them
- **Probability charts** — AI model vs Polymarket odds side by side (home / draw / away)
- **Per-team win rates** — home and away win % plus draw when they don’t sum to 100%
- **One-click market links** — bet CTA opens Polymarket when a market is found, otherwise Kalshi
- **Ask Analyst** — follow-up questions grounded in the current match analysis
- **Save in browser** — bookmark analyses locally (no account or server database)
