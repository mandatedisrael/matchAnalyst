# Match Analyst

**Polymarket Football AI Analyst** — an intelligent AI agent specialized in football (soccer) match analysis.

Users ask about upcoming matches across major leagues and competitions. The agent researches team form, head-to-head records, injuries, motivation, weather, and referee context, then outputs clear probability estimates with detailed reasoning. When available, Polymarket prices are shown for **market context only** — not as betting advice.

## Core Features

- Natural-language or structured match input (Premier League, La Liga, Champions League, World Cup qualifiers, etc.)
- Data-driven analysis from API-Football (form, H2H, injuries, standings, lineups)
- Polymarket-style probability output: `Home Win: 58% | Draw: 25% | Away Win: 17%`
- Side-by-side comparison with Polymarket odds when a market exists
- Interactive workspace with tabbed sections and live analysis progress
- Ask Analyst — conversational follow-ups grounded in the current analysis
- Favorite teams and saved research stored in your browser (no server database)
